# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert Spotify data into.
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,

tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,

#Then I inserted Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#I used SQL to answer the following questions about the data

#What is the average dancability of the songs by artist?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) as avg_dance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_dance desc;

#Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#Which artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#What is the average danceability for the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability IN (SELECT danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10);

#What is the average energy and loudness by artist?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(energy), AVG(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#How many songs does each artist have in the Spotify top 50?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)

#What is the name and acoustiness of the song with the lowest tempo?
SELECT track_name, acousticness, MIN(tempo)
