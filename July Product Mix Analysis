##I conducted an analysis using SQL of a restaurant's product mix from July 2024.
## I answered the following questions about the data to get information to set new pars for truck deliveries.

#How many flour tortillas were used? 
#The first query selects all the menu items that use 1 flour tortilla each.
#I used the LIKE function to avoid having to write out the full name of each item
#I had to use the AND function to filter out items that had similar names, but did not use flour tortillas.
SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.julypmix
WHERE Item LIKE '%Buffalo%'
OR Item LIKE '%Nashville%'
OR Item LIKE '%Paneer%'
OR Item LIKE '%Cauliflower%'

AND Item <> '#13 Shrimp Ceviche'
OR Item LIKE '%Fish%'
AND Menu = 'Food Menu'
OR Item LIKE '%Nashville Hot%'
OR Item LIKE '%Chicken Taco%'
OR Item LIKE '%Steak Taco%';
#I ran a second query for items that use 2 quesadillas.
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*2
FROM BIT_DB.julypmix
WHERE ITEM LIKE '%Quesadilla%';
#Added both queries together for the final answer.

#How many corn tortillas were used?
#I used the LIKE function to select the items that use 1 corn tortilla without having to write out all the names.
SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.julypmix
WHERE Item LIKE '%Grilled%'
OR Item LIKE '%GF%';
#I ran a second query for the items that use 2 corn tortillas per order.
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*2
FROM BIT_DB.julypmix
WHERE Item LIKE '%Birria%';
#I added up both queries for the final answer.

#How much chips did we sell?
#First, I ran a query to find out how many oz of chips were sold with our items that offer 5oz of chips each.
#I used AND statements because we have personal size quesos and catering sizes. I filtered out the catering sizes with the AND statement.

#Next, I ran a query to find out how many oz of chips were sold with our items that offer 8oz of chips each.
#Each of the queries following this accomplish the same purpose for different size menu items.
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*8

#I added up the number from all of these queries to get my final answer.

#How much cod are we selling? Convert to lbs.
#Each item sold has approx. 2 oz of protein
#I multiply the total items sold to get the total weight, then divide by 16 to convert to pounds.
#I use AND to filter my results because there are items on the drink menu with a name containing the word 'fish'.
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*2/16 AS 'lbs of fish'

#How many pounds of tater tots are we selling?

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*10/16 AS 'lb of tots'
FROM BIT_DB.julypmix

#I can now add up the total from the queries about to answer the question.

#How many bags of brisket are we selling?
#Each item that we sell has 2 oz of protein. Each bag contains 2 lb of protein.
#I ran a query to get the total amount of brisket items sold. I multiplied by 2 to get the total weight of brisket sold.
