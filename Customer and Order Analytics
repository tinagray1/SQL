#I used SQL to answer various questions about a database with multiple tables of data. These tables contain data about customers and their orders each month.

#How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#Select all the customer account numbers for all of the orders made in February
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON customers.order_id = feb.orderID;

#Which product was the cheapest sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN(SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_rev FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, price, location, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_rev
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
